This application displays 3D snapshots of simulated proteins.

You can select from several views of the molecular structure as well as rotate and zoom in and out.  More information can be found on the help screen which you can reach by pressing 'h'.

Folding@home is a distributed computing project -- people from throughout  the world download and run software to band together to make one of the largest supercomputers in the world. Every computer takes the project closer to our goals. Folding@home uses novel computational methods coupled with distributed computing, to simulate problems millions of times more challenging than previously achieved.

Proteins are biology's workhorses -- its "nanomachines."  Before proteins can carry out these important functions, they assemble themselves, or "fold". The process of protein folding, while critical and fundamental to virtually all of biology, in many ways remains a mystery.

When proteins do not fold correctly (i.e. "misfold"), there can be serious consequences.  Protein misfolding is linked to diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Mad Cow (BSE), CJD, ALS, Huntington's, Parkinson's, and many cancers and cancer-related syndromes.
